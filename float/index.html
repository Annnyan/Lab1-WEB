      1) A baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe and a male is called a buck.<br>
      2) Rabbits are very social creatures that live in groups. They live in warrens — a series of tunnels and rooms
      that they dig underground.<br>
      3) A rabbit's teeth never stop growing! Instead, they're gradually worn down as the rabbit chews on grasses,
      wildflowers and vegetables — meaning they never get too long.<br>
      4) Rabbits perform an athletic leap, known as a "binky", when they're happy — performing twists and kicks in mid
      air!<br>
      5) Rabbits' eyes are on the sides of their head, meaning they can see almost all the way around them. This helps
      them to keep a close watch for predators while they're going about their business!
